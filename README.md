# Fractional_ECM_fitting

Marcus Wilson 23 July 2024
This repository includes Matlab programmes for fitting an equivalent circuit model (ECM) to data of voltage V(t) and current I(t) for charging and discharging of a battery. 

The raw data is contained in .mat files (available from the author marcus.wilson@waikato.ac.nz on request - they are too large to include with this repository)
whose three columns are time (s), current (A) and voltage (V)


Under preparation
